              A satellite is an object in celestial mechanics that revolves
              along a certain trajectory (orbit) around another object.Sometimes
              the name "Cosmos" was assigned to vehicles that in other cases had
              their own names according to the relevant programs, for example,
              during tests and flights in the unmanned version of the Soyuz
              spacecraft of various options, the L1 / Zond lunar flyby
              spacecraft, the prototype lunar orbital spacecraft LOK of the
              lunar landing expeditionary complex L3, the TKS transport module,
              a reduced prototype of the orbital spaceplane of the Spiral
              reusable system.
