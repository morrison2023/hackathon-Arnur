              Planet (ancient Greek πλανήτης, an alternative form of ancient
              Greek πλάνης - "wanderer") - a celestial body orbiting a star or
              its remnants, massive enough to become round under the influence
              of its own gravity, but not massive enough to the beginning of a
              thermonuclear reaction, and managed to clear the vicinity of its
              orbit from planetesimals. Planets (ancient Greek πλανήτης, from
              other Greek πλάνης - “wanderer”), the Greeks called the so-called.
              "wandering stars".

              Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system and the closest
              to the sun. Named after the ancient Roman god of trade, Mercury is
              fast because it moves through the sky faster than other planets.
              Its period of revolution around the Sun is only 87.97 Earth days -
              the shortest among all the planets in the solar system.
