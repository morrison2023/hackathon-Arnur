                Outer space, space (ancient Greek κόσμος - “orderliness”,
                “order”) - relatively empty parts of the Universe that lie
                outside the boundaries of the atmospheres of celestial bodies.
                Space is not completely empty space: it contains, albeit with a
                very low density, interstellar matter (mainly hydrogen ions and
                atoms), cosmic rays and electromagnetic radiation, as well as
                hypothetical dark matter.

              <p>In its original understanding, the Greek term "cosmos" (world order) had a philosophical basis, defining a hypothetical closed vacuum around the Earth - the center of the Universe[1]. Nevertheless, in Latin-based languages ​​and its borrowings, the practical term “space” is used for the same semantics (since, from a scientific point of view, the vacuum enveloping the Earth is infinite), therefore, in Russian and related languages, as a result of reform correction, a kind of pleonasm “cosmic space” was born. space".</p>

              <p>There is no clear boundary, the atmosphere is gradually rarefied as it moves away from the earth's surface, and there is still no consensus on what to consider as a factor in the beginning of space. If the temperature were constant, then the pressure would change exponentially from 100 kPa at sea level to zero. The International Aviation Federation has set a height of 100 km (Karman line) as a working boundary between the atmosphere and space, because at this height, in order to create an aerodynamic lift force, it is necessary that the aircraft move at the first cosmic speed, which loses the meaning of air flight.</p>

              <p>The region of outer space surrounding the Sun, to which the solar wind propagates, is called the heliosphere. Within the heliosphere are the orbits of all the known planets of the solar system[6][Comm. 1]. The space of the heliosphere, free from large dense bodies, is filled with the so-called interplanetary medium, and the region of the interstellar medium begins behind the heliopause.
                The interplanetary medium is highly rarefied, but is not an absolute vacuum. The main part of its substance is the plasma of the solar wind (about 8 particles per cubic centimeter at the level of the Earth's orbit), in small quantities there are gases consisting of neutral atoms and molecules.</p>

              <p>According to NASA scientists, contrary to popular belief, when a person enters outer space without a protective spacesuit, a person will not freeze, explode and instantly lose consciousness, his blood will not boil - instead death will come from lack of oxygen. The danger lies in the process of decompression itself - it is this period of time that is most dangerous for the body, since during explosive decompression, gas bubbles in the blood begin to expand. If a refrigerant (for example, nitrogen) is present, then under such conditions it freezes the blood.
