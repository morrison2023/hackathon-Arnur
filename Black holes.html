              A region of space-time, the gravitational attraction of which is
              so great that even objects moving at the speed of light, including
              quanta of light itself, cannot leave it. The boundary of this
              region is called the event horizon.

              Sagittarius A * - a compact radio source located in the center of
              the Milky Way, is part of the radio source Sagittarius A. It also
              emits in the infrared, X-ray and other ranges.

              Holmberg 15A's ultramassive black hole is estimated to have a mass
              of 40 billion times that of the Sun. “This is the most massive
              black hole with a direct dynamical detection in the local
              Universe,” the researchers said.

            <p>
              IC 1101 is a class S0 supergiant (cD) lenticular galaxy at the
              center of the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster. It has an isophotal
              diameter at about 123.65 to 169.61 kiloparsecs (400,000 to 550,000
              ly). It possesses a diffuse core which is the largest known core
              of any galaxy to date, and also hosts a supermassive black hole
              that is one of the largest black holes known. The galaxy is
              located at 354.0 megaparsecs (1.15 billion light-years) from
              Earth. The galaxy was discovered on 19 June 1790, by the British
              astronomer William Herschel.

              A white hole is a hypothetical physical object in the Universe,
              into which nothing can enter. A white hole is the temporal
              opposite of a black hole and is predicted by the same general
              relativity equations as black holes. Most physicists are convinced
              that in principle there can be no white holes in nature.
