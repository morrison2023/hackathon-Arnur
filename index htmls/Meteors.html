              Meteorite (Greek Μετεώρος - raised into the air, in early
              Russian-language sources it is referred to as an air stone) - a
              body of cosmic origin that has reached the surface of the Earth
              [1] or another large celestial body. Most of the found meteorites
              have a mass from several grams to several tens of tons.

              This iron meteorite weighing about 66 tons and a volume of 9 m³
              fell in prehistoric times, and was found in 1920 in Namibia near
              Grotfontein. It got its name from Hoba West Farm, where, in fact,
              it was discovered by the owner of the farm. According to him, he
              came across a meteorite while plowing one of his fields. In 1929,
              the meteorite was studied by the British mineralogist Leonard
              Spencer.

              The meteorite fell in the area, which is called the "Field of
              Heaven" (Campo del Cielo). Here about 4 thousand years ago there
              was a meteor shower - a real downpour. It was caused, as
              researchers believe, by an asteroid weighing 800 tons, which flew
              from the asteroid belt located between Mars and Jupiter. In the
              immediate vicinity of the Earth, the guest split. Its numerous
              fragments fell on an area of ​​320 square kilometers. They have
              been looking for them recently. And find
