              A star is a massive self-luminous celestial body, consisting of
              gas and plasma, in which thermonuclear reactions take place, have
              taken place or will take place. The closest star to the Earth is
              the Sun, other stars in the night sky look like points of
              different brightness, maintaining their relative position.
