              Galaxy (ancient Greek γᾰλαξίας "Milky Way" from other Greek γάλα,
              γάλακτος "milk") is a gravitationally bound system of stars, star
              clusters, interstellar gas and dust, dark matter, and planets. All
              objects in the galaxy participate in motion relative to a common
              center of mass

              The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy that contains the Earth
              and the solar system. The radius of the stellar disk of the Milky
              Way and the radius of the Galaxy are 16 kiloparsecs. The total
              mass of the Galaxy, taking into account dark matter, is estimated
              as 1–2⋅10¹² M

              The Andromeda Galaxy is a spiral galaxy in the constellation
              Andromeda. Its diameter is 47 kiloparsecs, which is larger than
              that of our Galaxy, and it contains several times more stars than
              the Milky Way.

              The Cartwheel, also known as ESO 350-40, is a lenticular and
              ring-shaped galaxy about 500 million light-years from Earth in the
              constellation Sculptor. Its estimated diameter is 150,000 light
              years, and its mass is about 2.9–4.8 × 10⁹ solar masses. It
              rotates at a speed of 217 km/s

              The Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy is a hypothetical Local Group galaxy
              located in the constellation Canis Major. The galaxy contains a
              relatively large percentage of red giant stars, and is estimated
              to contain one billion stars.
